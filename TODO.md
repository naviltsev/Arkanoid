TODO

- stop calculating paddle size and collision shape programmatically
	- implement multiple scenes for each paddle type and switch between them
- save motion of ball when glue power up enabled and ball sticks to the paddle
+ ball sticks to the paddle on the sides
+ implement is_above_paddle() for correct collision detection if ball hits the side of the paddle
+ disable power up if global powerup timer is timed out
