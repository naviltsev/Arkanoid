TODO

- ball sticks to the paddle on the sides
- implement ball/paddle collision timer so that collision (and hence motion change) doesn't happen during a short period of time
    after prior collision
+ implement is_above_paddle() for correct collision detection if ball hits the side of the paddle
+ disable power up if global powerup timer is timed out
